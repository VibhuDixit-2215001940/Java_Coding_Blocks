        // Asymptotic Notations are mathematical tools that allow you to analyze an algorithm’s running time by identifying its behavior as its input size grows.

        //TYPES:-
        //1. Omega Notation-Formal way to express the lower bound of an algo running time.(best case analysis)
        // Lower bound means for any given input this notation determines best amount of time an algo can take to complete.

        //2.Big(O)Notations-Formal way to express the upper bound of an algo(worst case analysis)
        // Upper bound means for any given input this notation determines the longest amount of time an algo can take to compl.

        //3. Theta notations-Express both lower and upper bounds.
        // Avg time of an algo to complete.
