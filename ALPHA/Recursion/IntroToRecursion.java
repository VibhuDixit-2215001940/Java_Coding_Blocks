        //For this we have to find:-
            //1.Base condition
            //2.Working of every step
            //3.Looping


        //POINTING
        //After returning the pointer , one by one stack step is removing!! 
        //After returning the scope returns from base case to main value.

        ///STACK OVERFLOW
        //1.due to too many parameters
        //2.due to too amany caalls
        //3.due to absecence of base case
