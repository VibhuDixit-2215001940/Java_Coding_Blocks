        //The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.

        // How the ArrayList works
        // The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

        //How the LinkedList works
        // The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

        //         When To Use
        // Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.

        
        // Method	        Description	
        // addFirst()	    Adds an item to the beginning of the list.	
        // addLast()	    Add an item to the end of the list	
        // removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.	
        // removeLast()	    Remove an item from the end of the list	
        // getFirst()	    Get the item at the beginning of the list	
        // getLast()	    Get the item at the end of the list

        //NODE --> Each element is known as node.
        //It has two parts first for storing data & other for storing reference(address) of next node.
